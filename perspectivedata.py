st.markdown("""
    Passionate about technology and data in particular, I love to help my customers tackling challenges at the crossroad of architecture and transformation with a strategic mindset.
    I learnt and care that humans are the key to sustainable achievements. Hence, I invest in understanding various stakeholdersâ€™ perspectives to onboard and co-deliver solid results.
    
    Evolving in industrial contexts since my early studies, I deeply believe in (and experienced) the concrete value that data can bring there.
    With 15+ years at Airbus, I acquired concrete skills that I am today further developing and leveraging with other industries.

    I am connected to a network of data professionals that I can leverage to address specific or bigger projects.

    I am the happy father of 2 wonderdul daughters, love connecting with nature, swimming, reading, chat with friendsâ€¦ and listening to data and technology podcasts ðŸ¤“
